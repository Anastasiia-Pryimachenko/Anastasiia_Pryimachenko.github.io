      <li> During the 10th month of war in Ukraine, November, 
        russian occupants stole a huge amount of items from 
        museums and flats of Ukrainian civilians, that even 
        the most unuseful things were taken away.</li><br>
        
         <li>Animals from Kherson city, that is situated in the 
        South of Ukraine, alos were stolen and cruely taken 
        away from Ukraine. Raccoon became a symbol of 
        Kherson city after it happened, as many people started 
        claiming that they want the raccoon back at all costs.</li><br> 
        
         <li> The actions of harassment and amorality perfectly 
        describe actions and mentality of russian people.
        Unoftunately, still continue tortures toward Ukrainian
        people, animals and land.</li><br>

                <li>It is a well known fact, that any equipment is 
                  important and needed for people, who defend own country 
                  during the war. Ukraine is critically in the lack of military 
                  equipment and volunteers with civilians are constantly donating 
                  and creating fonds to gather money for further ordering the drones 
                  that help in destroying occupants.</li><br>
                
                 <li>There were many requests to Europe regarding giving tanks 
                  for Ukraine, so military would have a better change to hold 
                  the defense and move toward, freeing the lands that were invaded
                  and occupied by russians. </li><br> 
                
                 <li> After multiples press-conferences of Volodymyr Zelenskyi in 
                  Europe and USA, Germany finally allowed two deliver their tanks 
                  in a way to help Ukraine defeat its country. German-manufactured 
                  battle tanks Leopard 2 started its relocation by the end of 
                  January 2023, the 11th month of the war.</li><br>  
        
                  <li>Currently, in February 2023, Ukrainian military forces started 
                  their trainings in Poland and learning how professionally use 
                  the tanks Leopard 2.</li><br>
